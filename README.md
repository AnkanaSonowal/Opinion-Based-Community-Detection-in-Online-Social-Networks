# Opinion-Based-Community-Detection-in-Online-Social-Networks
Independent Research Work. Social Mining, Data Cleansing, Unsupervised Clustering Algorithms
Worked on independent research to detect communities in online social networks sharing similar opinions.
Extracted 1 lakh tweets using Tweepy, applied data cleaning and preprocessing, derived the opinions by using the Difference Model from the previous research project, used clustering algorithms like K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models(GMM), and Density Based Spatial Clustering of Algorithms with Noise(DBSCAN) to validate the communities formed. 
Improved performance by parameter estimation(DBSCAN) and cluster performance evaluation to determine the optimal number of clusters(K-Means, GMM).
